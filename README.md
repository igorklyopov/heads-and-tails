## Heads and tails game

In order to start the game - you need to go to the "Game"
page. A round of five throws is played. A "coin toss" is done
by answering the question: Are you ready to rumble? - yes. Then it
prompts the user to choose heads or tails. The game shows the user the
result of each throw - guessed or not. After the end of each round,
the game shows the player the result: the number of throws in the
round, the number of sets when the player won and when the casino won,
who won the round. The game then offers to play another round or end
the game.

On the "Statistics" page, you can see the results of each
round played. If the player starts the game again, the statistics of
previous rounds are not saved and the game starts from the first
round.

On the "Settings" page, you can turn sounds on/off, as well as
change the volume.
